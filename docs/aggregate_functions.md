# Aggregate functions

An *aggregate function* is a function that summarizes the rows of a group into a
single value. `COUNT`, `MIN` and `MAX` are examples of aggregate functions.

```sql
SELECT COUNT(*) as total_count, COUNT(fruit) as non_null_count,
       MIN(fruit) as min, MAX(fruit) as max
FROM (SELECT NULL as fruit UNION ALL
      SELECT "apple" as fruit UNION ALL
      SELECT "pear" as fruit UNION ALL
      SELECT "orange" as fruit)

+-------------+----------------+-------+------+
| total_count | non_null_count | min   | max  |
+-------------+----------------+-------+------+
| 4           | 3              | apple | pear |
+-------------+----------------+-------+------+
```

When used in conjunction with a `GROUP BY` clause, the groups summarized
typically have at least one row. When the associated `SELECT` has no `GROUP BY`
clause or when certain aggregate function modifiers filter rows from the group
to be summarized it is possible that the aggregate function needs to summarize
an empty group. In this case, the `COUNT` and `COUNTIF` functions return `0`,
while all other aggregate functions return `NULL`.

The following sections describe the aggregate functions that ZetaSQL
supports.

### ANY_VALUE

```
ANY_VALUE(expression [HAVING {MAX | MIN} expression2])  [OVER (...)]
```

**Description**

Returns `expression` for some row chosen from the group. Which row is chosen is
nondeterministic, not random. Returns `NULL` when the input produces no
rows. Returns `NULL` when `expression` is `NULL` for all rows in the group.

`ANY_VALUE` behaves as if `RESPECT NULLS` is specified;
Rows for which `expression` is `NULL` are considered and may be selected.

**Supported Argument Types**

Any

**Optional Clauses**

The clauses are applied *in the following order*:

1.  `OVER`: Specifies a window. See
    [Analytic Functions][analytic-functions].
1.  `HAVING MAX` or `HAVING MIN`: Restricts the set of rows that the
    function aggregates by a maximum or minimum value. See
    [HAVING MAX and HAVING MIN clause][max_min_clause] for details.

[floating-point-semantics]: https://github.com/google/zetasql/blob/master/docs/data-types#floating_point_semantics

**Returned Data Types**

Matches the input data type.

**Examples**

```sql
SELECT ANY_VALUE(fruit) as any_value
FROM UNNEST(["apple", "banana", "pear"]) as fruit;

+-----------+
| any_value |
+-----------+
| apple     |
+-----------+
```

```sql
SELECT
  fruit,
  ANY_VALUE(fruit) OVER (ORDER BY LENGTH(fruit) ROWS BETWEEN 1 PRECEDING AND CURRENT ROW) AS any_value
FROM UNNEST(["apple", "banana", "pear"]) as fruit;

+--------+-----------+
| fruit  | any_value |
+--------+-----------+
| pear   | pear      |
| apple  | pear      |
| banana | apple     |
+--------+-----------+
```

### ARRAY_AGG
```
ARRAY_AGG([DISTINCT] expression [{IGNORE|RESPECT} NULLS] [HAVING {MAX | MIN} expression2]
          [ORDER BY key [{ASC|DESC}] [, ... ]]  [LIMIT n])
[OVER (...)]
```

**Description**

Returns an ARRAY of `expression` values.

**Supported Argument Types**

All data types except ARRAY.

**Optional Clauses**

The clauses are applied *in the following order*:

1.  `OVER`: Specifies a window. See
    [Analytic Functions][analytic-functions].
1.  `DISTINCT`: Each distinct value of
    `expression` is aggregated only once into the result.
1.  `IGNORE NULLS` or `RESPECT NULLS`: If `IGNORE NULLS` is
    specified, the `NULL` values are excluded from the result. If
    `RESPECT NULLS` or if neither is specified, the `NULL` values are included
    in the result.
1.  `HAVING MAX` or `HAVING MIN`: Restricts the set of rows that the
    function aggregates by a maximum or minimum value. See
    [HAVING MAX and HAVING MIN clause][max_min_clause] for details.
1.  `ORDER BY`: Specifies the order of the values.
    *   For each sort key, the default sort direction is `ASC`.
    *   NULLs: In the context of the `ORDER BY` clause, NULLs are the minimum
        possible value; that is, NULLs appear first in `ASC` sorts and last in
        `DESC` sorts.
    *   Floating point data types: see
        [Floating Point Semantics][floating-point-semantics]
        on ordering and grouping.
    *   If `DISTINCT` is also specified, then
        the sort key must be the same as `expression`.
    *   If `ORDER BY` is not specified, the order of the elements in the output
        array is non-deterministic, which means you might receive a different
        result each time you use this function.
1.  `LIMIT`: Specifies the maximum number of `expression` inputs in the
    result.
    The limit `n` must be a constant INT64.

### ARRAY_CONCAT_AGG

```
ARRAY_CONCAT_AGG(expression [HAVING {MAX | MIN} expression2]  [ORDER BY key [{ASC|DESC}] [, ... ]]  [LIMIT n])
```

**Description**

Concatenates elements from `expression` of type
ARRAY, returning a single
ARRAY as a result. This function ignores NULL input
arrays, but respects the NULL elements in non-NULL input arrays.

**Supported Argument Types**

ARRAY

**Optional Clauses**

The clauses are applied *in the following order*:

1.  `HAVING MAX` or `HAVING MIN`: Restricts the set of rows that the
    function aggregates by a maximum or minimum value. See
    [HAVING MAX and HAVING MIN clause][max_min_clause] for details.
1.  `ORDER BY`: Specifies the order of the values.
    *   For each sort key, the default sort direction is `ASC`.
    *   NULLs: In the context of the `ORDER BY` clause, NULLs are the minimum
        possible value; that is, NULLs appear first in `ASC` sorts and last in
        `DESC` sorts.
    *   Floating point data types: see
        [Floating Point Semantics][floating-point-semantics]
        on ordering and grouping.
    *   If `ORDER BY` is not specified, the order of the elements in the output
        array is non-deterministic, which means you might receive a different
        result each time you use this function.
1.  `LIMIT`: Specifies the maximum number of `expression` inputs in the
    result.
    The limit applies to the number of input arrays, not
    the number of elements in the arrays. An empty array counts as 1. A NULL
    array is not counted.
    The limit `n` must be a constant INT64.

### STRING_AGG
```
STRING_AGG([DISTINCT] expression [, delimiter] [HAVING {MAX | MIN} expression2]  [ORDER BY key [{ASC|DESC}] [, ... ]]  [LIMIT n])
[OVER (...)]
```

**Description**

Returns a value (either STRING or
BYTES) obtained by concatenating non-null values.

If a `delimiter` is specified, concatenated values are separated by that
delimiter; otherwise, a comma is used as a delimiter.

**Supported Argument Types**

STRING
BYTES

**Optional Clauses**

The clauses are applied *in the following order*:

1.  `OVER`: Specifies a window. See
    [Analytic Functions][analytic-functions].
1.  `DISTINCT`: Each distinct value of
    `expression` is aggregated only once into the result.
1.  `HAVING MAX` or `HAVING MIN`: Restricts the set of rows that the
    function aggregates by a maximum or minimum value. See
    [HAVING MAX and HAVING MIN clause][max_min_clause] for details.
1.  `ORDER BY`: Specifies the order of the values.
    *   For each sort key, the default sort direction is `ASC`.
    *   NULLs: In the context of the `ORDER BY` clause, NULLs are the minimum
        possible value; that is, NULLs appear first in `ASC` sorts and last in
        `DESC` sorts.
    *   Floating point data types: see
        [Floating Point Semantics][floating-point-semantics]
        on ordering and grouping.
    *   If `DISTINCT` is also specified, then
        the sort key must be the same as `expression`.
    *   If `ORDER BY` is not specified, the order of the elements in the output
        array is non-deterministic, which means you might receive a different
        result each time you use this function.
1.  `LIMIT`: Specifies the maximum number of `expression` inputs in the
    result.
    The limit applies to the number of input strings,
    not the number of characters or bytes in the inputs. An empty string counts
    as 1. A NULL string is not counted.
    The limit `n` must be a constant INT64.

### SUM
```
SUM([DISTINCT] expression [HAVING {MAX | MIN} expression2])  [OVER (...)]
```

**Description**

Returns the sum of non-null values.

If the expression is a floating point value, the sum is non-deterministic, which
means you might receive a different result each time you use this function.

**Supported Argument Types**

Any supported numeric data types.

**Optional Clauses**

The clauses are applied *in the following order*:

1.  `OVER`: Specifies a window. See
    [Analytic Functions][analytic-functions].
1.  `DISTINCT`: Each distinct value of
    `expression` is aggregated only once into the result.
1.  `HAVING MAX` or `HAVING MIN`: Restricts the set of rows that the
    function aggregates by a maximum or minimum value. See
    [HAVING MAX and HAVING MIN clause][max_min_clause] for details.

### Common clauses

#### HAVING MAX and HAVING MIN clause {: #max_min_clause }

Most aggregate functions support two optional clauses called `HAVING MAX` and
`HAVING MIN`, which restricts the set of rows that a function aggregates to
rows that have a maximal or minimal value in a particular column. The syntax
generally looks like this:

```sql
aggregate_function(expression1 [HAVING {MAX | MIN} expression2])
```

+ `HAVING MAX`: Restricts the set of rows that the
  function aggregates to those having a value for `expression2` equal to the
  maximum value for `expression2` within the group. The  maximum value is
  equal to the result of `MAX(expression2)`.
+ `HAVING MIN` Restricts the set of rows that the
  function aggregates to those having a value for `expression2` equal to the
  minimum value for `expression2` within the group. The minimum value is
  equal to the result of `MIN(expression2)`.

These clauses ignore `NULL` values when computing the maximum or minimum
value unless `expression2` evaluates to `NULL` for all rows.

 These clauses do not support the following
data types:
`ARRAY`
`STRUCT`
`PROTO`

**Example**

In this example, the average rainfall is returned for the most recent year,
2001.

```sql
WITH Precipitation AS
 (SELECT 2001 as year, 'spring' as season, 9 as inches UNION ALL
  SELECT 2001, 'winter', 1 UNION ALL
  SELECT 2000, 'fall', 3 UNION ALL
  SELECT 2000, 'summer', 5 UNION ALL
  SELECT 2000, 'spring', 7 UNION ALL
  SELECT 2000, 'winter', 2)
SELECT AVG(inches HAVING MAX year) as average FROM Precipitation

+---------+
| average |
+---------+
| 5       |
+---------+
```

First, the query gets the rows with the maximum value in the `year` column.
There are two:

```sql
+------+--------+--------+
| year | season | inches |
+------+--------+--------+
| 2001 | spring | 9      |
| 2001 | winter | 1      |
+------+--------+--------+
```

Finally, the query averages the values in the `inches` column (9 and 1) with
this result:

```sql
+---------+
| average |
+---------+
| 5       |
+---------+
```
